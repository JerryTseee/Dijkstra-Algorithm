Greedy algorithm does not produce an optimal solution, but can yield locally optimal
solutions that approxiamte a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time

The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made so far,
but not on future choices or all the solutions to the subproblem.
It iteratively makes one greedy choice after another. (Not like dynamic programming
which makes decisions based on all the decisions made in previous stage)
